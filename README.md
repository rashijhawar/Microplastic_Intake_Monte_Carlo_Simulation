# Monte Carlo Simulation: Estimating Human Microplastic Intake through Food, Water, and Air
## Team Members: Rashi Jhawar and Tejal Bhansali

## üí° Project Overview
This project simulates daily human intake of microplastics (MP) through air, food, and water across different countries and dietary patterns using a Monte Carlo simulation. We have also tried to identify how each of the sources contributes to the total microplastic intake.

## üß© Phase 1 of Monte Carlo Simulation: Design
### Random Variables
1. Daily per capita intake for 18 food categories ‚Äã(in g)
2. Microplastic concentration in a gram of different categories of food (in mg of microplastic/g of food)
3. Microplastics consumed through water (in mg)*
4. Microplastics consumed through air (in particles)*
5. Microplastic weight (in mg)

\* Microplastic consumption values represent daily consumption by a single individual

### Assumptions

- **Intake of food, water, and air** follows a **log-normal distribution**
- **Weight of a microplastic particle** follows a **modified PERT distribution**
- **Standard deviation** for log-normal distribution is assumed to be **25% of the mean**
- Total microplastic exposure occurs only through 3 pathways: **food, water and air.**

## ‚úÖ Phase 2 of Monte Carlo Simulation: Validation
We ran the simulation for a subset of countries and found our results to be comparable with the published microplastic intake values for these countries.

The convergence plot was as follows:

## üß™ Phase 3 of Monte Carlo Simulation: Experimentation

### üìä Hypothesis 1

- Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference between microplastic consumption between developed and developing countries.
- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference between microplastic consumption between developed and developing countries.

**Results:**

We observed that there was not much of a difference in microplastic consumption between developed and developing countries. Therefore, we concluded that microplastic intake did not depend on whether a country was developing or developed, and hence, we accept the null hypothesis.‚Äã

**Some more visualizations from the simulation:**

This chart helps give a view of the percentage contribution of each source to the total intake.

### üìä Hypothesis 2

- Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in microplastic intake across different diet groups.
- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in microplastic intake across different diet groups.
